GoLang example for starter

```go build``` --> generate *.exe (manually run *.exe)

## Syntax Note
- Go use compiler for build *.go into platform(OS)'s binary (executable)
- unused import, variable will throw compile error
- ***panic*** is name of runtime error
- Go use copy value to assign variable (also copy all in struct)
- Must use pointer(& reference, * dereference) if need to reference to address
